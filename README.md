# Zaid Sayyed — Cybersecurity Foundations Portfolio

## About Me
I am an IT graduate building a foundation in cybersecurity with a focus on **network exposure, authentication security, and defensive system hardening**.  
This repository documents hands-on labs where I analyzed how services create attack surfaces and how defenders reduce risk through configuration, monitoring, and layered controls.

## What This Repository Demonstrates
- Understanding of **attack surface creation and removal**
- Ability to analyze **authentication failures and user enumeration**
- Practical **SSH hardening** with real-world configuration precedence
- Difference between **service hardening and network-level exposure**
- Clear documentation and security reasoning (not just tools)

## Labs Overview

### 🔹 Network & Service Exposure
- **Lab 03:** TCP vs UDP Visibility 
- **Lab 04:** Service Lifecycle and Port Exposure 

### 🔹 Authentication & Enumeration
- **Lab 05:** SSH as an Attack Surface 
- **Lab 06:** Authentication Failure Patterns 
- **Lab 07:** User Enumeration via SSH 

### 🔹 Secure Access & Hardening
- **Lab 08:** Passwords vs Key-Based Authentication  
- **Lab 09:** SSH Hardening with Configuration Precedence  

### 🔹 Network-Level Defense
- **Lab 10:** Firewall vs Service Exposure  

Each lab includes:
- Objective
- Commands used
- Observations
- Security takeaway

## Why This Matters for Security Roles
These labs mirror real-world defensive tasks performed in:
- SOC Analyst (L1)
- Security Operations
- Network / Infrastructure Security
- Blue Team roles

The focus is on **reasoning, detection, and risk reduction**, not exploitation.

## Tools Used
- Linux (Kali)
- SSH
- systemd
- ss, nmap
- UFW
- Git & GitHub

## Next Steps
- Traffic analysis with Wireshark
- Log-based detection scenarios
- Network segmentation concepts
